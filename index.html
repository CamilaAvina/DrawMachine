  <p>In this Machine, experience the view of a person who may be colorblind. Many of us are not aware how much color can effect what you are seeing. In some ways people do not notice the changes that happen. When it comes to colorblindness people can not distinguish colors like red and green and instead they see the color like this background on the screen.</p>
